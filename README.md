# MoodFi - The Emotion-Powered Token Economy

Welcome to **MoodFi**, the first decentralized finance platform where global sentiment and real-world events shape token behaviors and rewards. Built on **Ethereum**, MoodFi leverages advanced AI-driven sentiment analysis and real-time news feeds to create a dynamic, emotionally responsive financial ecosystem.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Emotion-Driven Token Fluctuations
Tokens on MoodFi are directly influenced by real-world sentiments extracted from social media, news articles, and major global events. Sentiment scores, ranging from **0 (negative)** to **100 (positive)**, drive dynamic tokenomics, affecting:

- **Minting rates**: Positive sentiment can increase token supply.
- **Burning rates**: Negative sentiment accelerates deflation.
- **Staking APYs**: Optimistic events yield higher rewards.

---

### 2. Sentiment Mining
Participants in MoodFi can earn rewards by mining sentiment data. By contributing sentiment analysis reports or validating AI-generated sentiment scores, users receive **$MOOD tokens**. This decentralized sentiment mining incentivizes **accuracy** and **data diversity**.

---

### 3. Customizable Sentiment-Responsive Agents (SRAs)
Users can create and deploy **Sentiment-Responsive Agents (SRAs)** with unique global sentiment triggers.

#### Trigger Types:
- **Economy-based**: Inflation reports or GDP growth.
- **Social sentiment**: Major hashtags or viral news.
- **Political sentiment**: Elections or geopolitical events.

Each SRA has customizable behavior tied to sentiment, such as:
- Airdrop percentages
- Token buybacks

---

### 4. Dynamic Staking Pools
MoodFi offers sentiment-driven staking pools:

- **Positive Pool**: High sentiment periods yield higher rewards but carry volatility risk.
- **Negative Pool**: Lower sentiment offers more stable returns with lower APY.

### Step 1: Create Your MoodFi Agent
Define your agent's emotional triggers and tokenomics behavior. Example:

### Step 2: Launch Your Token
Deploy a token with customizable minting, staking, and burning rules tied to sentiment indicators.
